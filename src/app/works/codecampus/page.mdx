This is a work in progress learning platform.

It will be a database of knowledge for anyone to use and contribute to!.

## Goals

Well for now I will improve the learning documents everyday.

At some point I will start releasing video lessons on YouTube covering materials in the website!

The biggest goal of this project is to be a source of knowledge for anyone, and to achieve this I will contribute to it to my last day!

### Tools used

}
