Repository link -> [Repository](https://github.com/pbelokon/writer)

Writer is a versatile editor which combines user friendly design of Visual Studio and functionality of Emacs.

## Goals

My main goal with this project is to follow in libra office steps and create and open source lightweight editor
that anyone can use!

It will be multi platform so you will even be able to use it on the phone.

### Tools used

Godot, C#, .Net

export default function MDXPage({ children }) {
  return <MdxLayout>{children}</MdxLayout>;
}
