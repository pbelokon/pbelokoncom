This was one of the most complex and long projects I have worked on in school.
I was tasked with creating a test driven microservice for a factory.

Actual complexity was that I was only given requirements list and some tool suggestions to complete this project.
So no teacher's help or looking at steps in the assignment.

## Project Goals

Built a Factory Management Microservice providing reporting and data logging solutions, with built-in

Leveraged Docker containers to isolate application environment for reproducible builds.

Automated deployments with CI/CD pipeline on AWS, with automated testing for increased reliability.

Designed and implemented a lightweight vanilla JavaScript browser front-end client for ease of usage of
the service

support for multiple file formats.

### Tools used

Docker, AWS(EC2), Jest(unit tests), CI/CD, Node, Hurl(integration tests)

export default function MDXPage({ children }) {
  return <MdxLayout>{children}</MdxLayout>;
}
